This script goes through all of the BIN files in a specified folder and pulls out the first 39 lines of code from them, 
which contain all of the important information we need about the Geneactive devices. 

Please rename the folder input and output before running. A condensed file is made at the output folder,
named "condensed_{original_filename}".
